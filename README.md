<h1> Automated airflow installation using docker </h1>

Here I have built the bash script to install airflow using docker on your system without any hustle, just follow the commands:

**STEP 01 - ```cd <REPO_DIR>```** # getting into the repository directory

**STEP 02 - ```chmod +x airflow-docker-setup.sh```** # making bash script executable

**STEP 03 - ```./airflow-docker-setup.sh```** # execute the script

Hit **http://localhost:8080/** to get airflow login page.

**BAM!**

In case you face error while running the bash script, just open the airflow-docker-setup.sh and I have mentioned few errors in comments with there solution links.
