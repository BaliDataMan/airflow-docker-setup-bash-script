<h1> Automated airflow installation using docker </h1>

Here I have built the bash script to install airflow using docker on your system without any hustle, just follow the commands:

STEP 01 - cd <REPO_DIR>
STEP 02 - chmod +x airflow-docker-setup.sh
STEP 03 - ./airflow-docker-setup.sh

Hit http://localhost:8080/ to get airflow login page.

NOTE - If you face errors while running the bash script, just open the airflow-docker-setup.sh and I have mentioned expected errors in comments with there solution links.
